              I joined the company as an Associate engineer. In the initial days
              I started working on version 1 of Pondlogs which is a tool used
              for configuring IOT devices manufactured by our company. I have to
              use jquery, php and Mysql for maintaining the application along
              with two other persons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later I was assigned to learn the vue.js framework which is used
              as frontend for version 2 of Pondlogs application. I am the only
              person in the frontend upto one year for the newer version which
              helped me in developing the ability to work independently. After
              that team size increased to 3 persons. As I was re-writing each
              part of the old version I learned element-ui, Highcharts (library
              for data visualization), Google Maps Api, date-fns,
              momentjs,xlsx.js, fuse.js(elastic search at frontend),
              webpack(bundling), and vue.js ecosystem(vuex, vue router, vuei18n,
              virtual scroller, vue-grid-layout). Also I gained some expertise
              in using git for software verisioning.

              <strong> I have implemented the following features:</strong>
              <ol className="list-group list-group-numbered ">
                <li className=" list-group-item ">
                  Built Dashboards where processing and computation is
                  implemented at client side using web workers over thousands of
                  records at frontend using highcharts. Also implemented
                  resizing the charts using resize observer which resulted in
                  performance bottleneck in one page. Here I resolved the
                  performance issue by using throttling inside request animation
                  frame function.

                  Maps Page where the customers(shrimp farmers) are allowed to
                  draw ponds on the google maps canvas and data visualization
                  such as changing the draw pond color based on IOT devices data
                  and preferences provided by the user. In this I faced
                  challenges such as managing the states of the maps, handling
                  geometric data.

                  Extending the functionality for components such as date
                  picker, image previewer, tables and implementing base
                  components on the element-ui components for allowing
                  customization to our business needs. Here I have also changed
                  the default webpack, and vuejs configuration to resolve the
                  compilation issues.
                </li>
                <li className="list-group-item ">
                  Fuzzy search and highlighting the found part in the data for a
                  search using fuse.js, exporting the data as pdf and excel
                  using jspdf,xlsx.js on the tables. Here I have extended the
                  element ui table api and provided an interface that takes
                  configuration objects enables these features.

                  Access control management for different types of users over
                  entire application adhereing to SOLID priciples. Here by using
                  a permission object and a custom implemented mixin I was able
                  to handle the access control at each level from pages to
                  components.

                  Image preview viewer using virtual scroller, vue-grid-layout,
                  along with lazy loading using lozad. Here I made a component
                  that takes the array of objects containing image url and
                  images meta data as input and displays the grid of images.

            I joined this company in July 2017. During the Initial 3 months I
            was in the ILP phase where I improved my programming skills in Java
            and developed a Banking management application using the Java
            Servlet Page and deployed using Tomcat server. Later I was assigned
            to the Citi Bank project. In that I was assigned to small team to
            start working on automating the BPA tasks using HP UFT, C# and
            VBScript. Here I worked on extracting the data from PDF files using
            Itextsharp, regular expressions and segregated the pdf based on the
            keywords found in the pdf files. I also need to extract values from
            the pdf Files and place them in the excel. I also implemented
            styling, and formatting the excel files using VBScript and UFT. The
            data extracted from the pdf files will be verified with other web
            and desktop applications related to citibank which will be a tedious
            task to do manually. During my free time I did Machine learning in
            Coursera offered by Andrew Ng which is one that helped me to place
            in my latter company.
